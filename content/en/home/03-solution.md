core_philosophy_body: "The most basic element of Feldenkrais is faith in your ability to improve. We don't \"correct\" you or force you into a pose. We use gentle, mindful movement to wake up your brain. Just as a child learns to walk without a manual—driven by curiosity—we re-awaken that innate ability. We use Neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to change) to update your \"internal software,\" replacing restrictive habits with fluid, efficient options."
founder_title: "The Genius Behind the Method"
founder_body: "Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais (1904-1984) was a Renaissance man: a physicist, an engineer, and the first European to earn a Judo Black Belt. When a severe knee injury threatened his ability to walk, doctors offered a 50% chance of success with surgery. He refused. Instead, he applied his deep knowledge of physics and neurology to heal himself. He didn't just fix his knee; he discovered a revolutionary way to rewire the human nervous system."
