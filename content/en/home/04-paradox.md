  - myth: "Myth 1: \"Faster is Better.\""
    truth: "Speed hides mistakes. We move slowly not because we are lazy, but because slowness allows the brain to notice how you move. To learn fast, you must go slow."
  - myth: "Myth 2: \"No Pain, No Gain.\""
    truth: "Effort masks sensitivity. If you are gritting your teeth, you aren't learning; you are just surviving. We reduce effort to increase sensitivity."
  - myth: "Myth 3: \"Fix Me.\""
    truth: "We don't impose \"correct posture\" from the outside. We guide you to discover your own organic support from the inside. It's not about following rules; it's about finding freedom."
