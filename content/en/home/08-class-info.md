vibe: "I don't demonstrate; I guide. You won't be copying me. Instead, you'll lie on a mat and follow verbal instructions to explore gentle movement puzzles. It is a time to shut out the world and listen to yourself."

effort: "Minimal. If you are straining, you are doing too much. We look for the path of least resistance."
wear_title: "What to Wear"
wear: "Comfort over style. Wear loose, warm, comfortable layers (e.g., sweatpants, long sleeves). You won't be sweating, and as your nervous system calms down, your body temperature might drop slightly. No shoes required."
